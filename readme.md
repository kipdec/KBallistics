# KBallistics

This is my attempt to make an open-source ballistics solver from first principles using F#. The purpose of this project is to further explore functional programming and physics.

## Installation

TBD. There is no finished work product for this project yet. The most interestingthing to do is explore the BallisticsLib.FSharp library via `dotnet fsi` and run some calculations using the functions.

## TODO
- [ ] Build initial PWA App
- [ ] Add env variables
    - [ ] Pressure
    - [ ] Wind
    - [ ] Altitdude
